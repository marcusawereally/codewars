function songDecoder(song){
  /** function to "decode" a dubstep song.  
  The concept helped with my learning strings methods
  regular expression replacement and trim.  I learned how to 
  use a quantifier on a non-capturing group.  I also learned
  that trim only removes the spaces at the end of the code.  
  Upon submitting the following code and reviewing code
  submitted by others: I learned that I could have made this
  more succinct by appending the trim directly after the regex.
  **/
  var regex = /(?:WUB)+/g;
  words = song;
  //use Regular Expression search to remove the WUBS
  words = words.replace(regex,' ');
  //use trim to clean up both sides of the string.
  words = words.trim();
  //return the new string to the user.
  return words;
}
