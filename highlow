/*
this one was a bit tricky.  I had to make use of typeof a few times to realize that they were being passed as a string.  I read the
instructions incorrectly.  they were "valid" int32s inside a string.  I missed the "string" part and assumed it was an array of int32s.
I am curious to see what the solutions show and what I can learn this time.
